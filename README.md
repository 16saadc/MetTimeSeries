# Met Time Series Forecasting

## Setup instructions

``` pip install -r requirements.txt```


## Running the analysis

The following command will open a web page that will display my results. Once you run it, all the data processing, model training, and results/analysis will automatically execute. 

If you prefer not to wait for everything to run (training can take a while -- 45 mins), I have attached a PDF of the webpage the last time I ran it.

``` streamlit run main.py ```
or
```python -m streamlit run main.py```
